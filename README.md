# Texas-Oil-Project
Oil Production Midterm Project

## Project Overview
This project investigates how **Texas oil prices** have impacted **Texas oil production** - measured by well counts and barrel production.  
We scarped data on our individual variables to create a combined dataset to study production trends, economic cycles and potential casual relationships between production activity and the broader economic preformance. 
We utilized regression analysis and a time-series technique to identify whether increases in oil output or well counts are associated with changes in oil prices.

### Research Questions
* How have Texas oil well counts and production levels evolved over time? 
* Is there a measurable relationship between oil production and oil prices?  

## Data Sources
- Texas Railroad Commision (Oil Well Counts)
- US Energy Information Administration (Oil Prices per Barrel, Number of Barrels Produced)
- FRED (Texas State GDP)
